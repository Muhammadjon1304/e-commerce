# E-commerce
E-commerce is backend marketplace API project that I made during my intern period.

## Description

My E-commerce application deals with registering,logging,getting profiles of users and cart operations.Moreover,product and order management system.

I used Golang for implementing REST API as it is simply designed.Golang's Gin framework is used for dealing with web-operations.Additionally,I used PostgreSQL as a relational database.For testing I used Postman and SwaggerUI

During development process I faced with problems related to REST pattern,Database operations,third party libraries and Operational systems.I solved them with the help of my mentor,online forums.
